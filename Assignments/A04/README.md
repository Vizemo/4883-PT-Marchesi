## A04 - What To Do
### Victor Marchesi
### Description:

Prepare a 1-2 paragraph synopsis of your plan if you had to teach this course. The basic questions are: Does Griffin just help us all connect to UvA online judge? Do we use another existing platform instead? Do we build .... I'm not sure what I want to ask. Lets talk in class.

### Work

I would prefer to use either Hackerank or Leetcode. I have used Hackerank in the past when I first got into computer science and thought the overall UI and interactions with the service were good. Leetcode is the best option in my opinion as I have done quite a few problems, and the ease of use is a huge plus for me. With leetcode we can be assigned a problem, and solve the problem right one the app. You could even do it on your phone which is not the best, but it is possible.

### Example Command

- None.
