## A09 - Convex Hull
### Victor Marchesi
### Description:

Here is a Python implementation of Graham's Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points. This algorithm sorts the points by polar angle with respect to a reference point (usually the one with the lowest y-coordinate), and then processes the points to eliminate those that don't form part of the convex hull.
