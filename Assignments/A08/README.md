## Description

- Both DFS and BFS are foundational graph traversal algorithms that can be used in a variety of problems, including those involving connected components, tree traversals, and exploring graph-based data structures. Here are 5 LeetCode problems that require graph traversal (DFS/BFS). I explicitly avoided shortest path or spanning tree algorithms.

- I chose REPLACEME
- [LINK](https://github.com/rugbyprof/4883-Programming_Techniques/tree/master/Assignments/08-A08) to the github instructions.
- The file chart below contains the documents for the assignment with short descriptions.
- Underneath the file chart is code solution is displayed.
