### Victor Marchesi
### Description:

Both DFS and BFS are foundational graph traversal algorithms that can be used in a variety of problems, including those involving connected components, tree traversals, and exploring graph-based data structures. Here are 5 LeetCode problems that require graph traversal (DFS/BFS). I explicitly avoided shortest path or spanning tree algorithms.
